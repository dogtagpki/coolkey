   Include Java source code

0.9.8: Jul 2002
   Include the converted CAP file

0.9.7: Mar 2002
   Inclusion of GemXpressoRADIII support

0.9.6: Nov 2001
   Split the packages

0.9.5:
   First release


REQUIREMENTS
============================================================
In order to use this program, you must have a JavaCard 2.1.1
compliant smart card and a supported smart card reader.
You must also have all the software required to load a Java
Card Applet on your smartcard.

Different smart card vendors provide emulators for their own
smart cards. You can also try loading this program into an
emulated card. In this case you don't need cards nor readers
to be connected to your system.


DESCRIPTION
============================================================
This package contains source code and precompiled binaries for
the Card Edge Applet, a free implementation of the Cryptographic
Card Edge Definition for Java Enabled Smartcards.

  http://www.musclecard.com/musclecard/

Note that different versions of this Applet could be released,
with different features disabled, in order to let you save
space on the card if your application does not require those
features at all.


ADDITIONAL FEATURES
============================================================
This Applet actually supports some pin policy enforcement.
Checks are made on the pin size, character set and mix of
characters.
The exact pin policy depends on parameters provided at
instantiation time.


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
============================================================
This Applet has been tested with Schlumberger Cyberflex
Access 32K cards, Gemplus Gxp 211 PK, Gemplus GemXploreXpresso v3
and is known to work with most cryptographic features involving
RSA and DES keys. DSA testing still needs to be done with cards
supporting it.


KNOWN BUGS
============================================================
None at the moment (02-Oct-2002)


SUPPORT
============================================================
